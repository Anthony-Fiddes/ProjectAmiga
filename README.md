### _Project Purpose_

With many of our classmates, friends, and loved ones being worn thin by the ever-increasing pressures of school, work, and society, it is more important than ever to keep an eye on our mental well-being. 

Ninety-five percent of college counseling center directors surveyed said the number of students with significant psychological problems is a growing concern in their center or on campus, according to the latest Association for University and College Counseling Center Directors survey of counseling center directors.

We felt the issue particularly relevant for university students, many of whom are experiencing college virtually. More than ever, it is crucial for students to create and sustain healthy habits for the maintenance of their mental health. 

### _The Intent and Approach_

**Amiga** aims to improve the mental health of its users by logging moods and emotions over time, thereby enabling the visualization and analysis of their mental health. Getting into the habit of keeping logs and to-dos is an important way of relieving work/societal stressors; we believe the satisfaction from completing tasks and removing impediments from one's daily life is an important first step in improving mental health.

Using the _Stats_ feature, users can visualize their moods over time, with ratings viewable over a week, a month, and even a year. With regular use, these graphs can be shared externally, such as with a psychiatrist or licensed social worker.

The _Maps_ feature locates the user and suggests nearby location aimed to help relieve stress, such as local libraries, caf√©s, parks, and therapist offices. Users can select a nearby location and open an integrated navigation client to get there quickly and safely.

An integrated _To-Do List_ feature populates tasks to a simple list that the user can then complete as needed. We hope that users gather a feeling of accomplishment as they check off items from the list.

All of these features are gamified through the implementation of the _Achievements_ feature, which rewards users with fun badges based on their level of usage of **Amiga**. Increased usage is rewarded with increasingly rare badges and icons. 

### Getting Started

Get started with **Amiga** by opening the app and creating an account with your email address and password. Your email address is the key bit of information that makes your account unique. 

Once you've created your account, you can select a cartoon _avatar_ to reflect who you are to others on the app. 

### Using **Amiga**

Create your first log on the home screen by selecting your mood using the slider, adding some "journal entry" text, and selecting some moods to associate with your log. The moods and emotions can be tracked in a variety of places, such as in the _Stats_ page. Logging daily will increase your _Streak_, which tabulates how many consecutive days you've logged for. Keep logging daily to increase your streak and unlock bold new achievements.

It's helpful to read over your logs in the _Feed_ page, where you can see how you felt day-over-day. You can also track these trends over longer periods of time using the _Stats_ page's mood graph, which charts date against mood. The color-rich interface is designed to make seeing and understanding your logs easy, quick, and stress-free. 

To-dos are a simple part of life, and tracking them in **Amiga** makes it that much easier to get things done. Simply write down what you need to get done. **Amiga** stores that item for you, and when you complete it, come back to **Amiga** to cross it off. Satisfying!

### Friends and Achievements

**Amiga** is more fun with friends! Add friends by inserting their email address in the _Friends_ tab. This will send them a friend request, and after it is accepted, you can visualize each others' achievements and more! Comparing streaks with friends is fun on **Amiga** and keeps you on top of your logging game while also developing positive habits and helping you track your mood.
